- Initial Release

1.0.1-ALPHA:

- Improvement: Project is built with Maven.
- Improvement: Added more config comments to the config in case you needed extra help configuring it.
- Improvement: Project is open source.

1.0.2-ALPHA:
- Since 1.0.1-ALPHA, nobody has reported that the version doesn't even start up (until now). Very simple fix. Thanks to iBugged for notifying me!
- Compiled in Spigot 1.16.1. This has no effect on the plugin. This version continues to support legacy versions too.
